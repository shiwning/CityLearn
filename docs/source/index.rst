CityLearn is an open source OpenAI Gym environment for the implementation of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) for building energy coordination and demand response in cities :cite:p:`https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2012.10504, 10.1145/3360322.3360998`. A major challenge for RL in demand response is the ability to compare algorithm performance :cite:p:`VAZQUEZCANTELI20191072`. Thus, CityLearn facilitates and standardizes the evaluation of RL agents such that different algorithms can be easily compared with each other.

Districts and cities have periods of high demand for electricity, which raise electricity prices and the overall cost of the power distribution networks. Flattening, smoothening, and reducing the overall curve of electrical demand helps reduce operational and capital costs of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution networks. CityLearn allows the easy implementation of reinforcement learning agents in a single or multi-agent setting to reshape their aggregated curve of electrical demand by controlling the storage of energy by every agent.
